# Amazon-Clone
This project is a responsive shopping homepage inspired by Amazon’s design. Built using HTML and CSS, it features a structured navigation bar, a promotional hero section, a multi-panel category layout, and a clean footer. Each section is carefully styled with CSS Flexbox and Grid, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent layout across devices.

 Technologies Used
- HTML5 – For the semantic structure of the webpage, including navbars, hero sections, product boxes, and footer.
- CSS3 – For styling, layout, typography, colors, spacing, and visual effects like hover borders and transitions.
