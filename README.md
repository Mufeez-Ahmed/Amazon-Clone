# Amazon-Clone
This project is a responsive shopping homepage inspired by Amazonâ€™s design. Built using HTML and CSS, it features a structured navigation bar, a promotional hero section, a multi-panel category layout, and a clean footer. Each section is carefully styled with CSS Flexbox and Grid, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent layout across devices.
